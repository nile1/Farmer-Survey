# Light-Sensor
It is test program to create appropriate classifier for light sensor value for the detection of Indoor/Outdoor. This project helps the user to take light sensor values at different time of the day and store it in a database using node.js and Mongodb. Is also creates an csv file in the device memory. This values then can be used to create classifiers for Indoor/Outdoor detection using WEKA. This program can also be used as sample code for exacting light sensor on android, creating and saving data in csv file android, Json object parse from android to a server, server side programming to receive, extract and save json data to mongodb using nodejs.
